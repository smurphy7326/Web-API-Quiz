# Web-API-Quiz

## Purpose
The UCONN Coding Bootcamp assigned us a task to make a timed multiple choice quiz. The purpose of the quiz is to see how well we are learning the concepts we have been taught so far throughout the bootcamp. We were to make questions about the first few weeks, and have a scoreboard at the end as well in order to guage how we are doing compared to our peers. The questions were to be given and when an answer was chosen say whether it was correct or incorrect right there. If selecting a wring answer, you will be penalized 10 seconds. At the end there would be an oppertunity for student to put their initials on the leaderboard to see how they are doing, and compare themselves to other people in the class.
